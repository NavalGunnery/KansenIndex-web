Funny project start because how I noticed there are far more games involves ship anthropomorphism than I have ever imagined, and thought it would be really nice to gather all of them in one place and see how the same (war)ship is portrayed in different franchises, all while still being cute anime girls.

I try to acquire the highest quality official images from these franchises whether by datamining or using sources which I can confidently confirm receive no quality loss compared to datamined CG when possible.

However due to the live-service nature of some games listed here, their CGs has not been preserved. If you happen to have these game's original resource files or have any question regarding the site, feel free to contact me via <neroyuki241@gmail.com>
